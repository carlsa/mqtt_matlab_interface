# mqtt_matlab_interface
MATLAB interface to mqtt based on the Paho Java client

Bare bones implementation which allows to connect to an mqtt broker (e.g. http://emqtt.io/), publish and subscribe to topics.

Extending functionalities is straightforward:
- the java source files in the `src` directory can be modified to add the funcionality one wants (e.g. setting the QoS parameter for the subscriber)
- once the .java file has been modified, a .jar file can be generated by running `sh pack_to_jar.sh` from the `src` directory
- the java classes packed in the jar files in the `jars` folder are then imported in MATLAB as done, for instance, in `example.m`
